                <p id="about-txt">
                In the fall of 2019, I had the privilege of taking a queer literature class at 
                the University of Michigan with David M. Halperin, founder and editor of GLQ magazine 
                and Gay Shame as well as author of many quintessential queer books such as Saint Foucault. 
                That class was labeled in my course guide as Bad Homosexuals, and under David's tutelage my 
                classmates and I read and dissected the intricacies of what it means to be represented in literature, 
                and what kinds of depictions do harm versus good for LGBTQ+ progress. As a newly-out lesbian, an 
                anarcho-communist and a radical transgender rights advocate, I was struggling to find my footing in a 
                community where I felt my radical leftism, my sexual punk aesthetic and attitude, and my struggles with 
                mental illness were looked down upon. David M. Halperin's class was a place where I felt at home with the 
                likes of Jean Genet, Dennis Cooper and Sarah Schulman, taking comfort in a literary canon of queerness 
                where queer people were allowed to be radical, poor, trans, emotional, sexual, imperfect--and otherwise "bad".
                <br><br>
                Inspired by Diana DiMassa's Hothead Paisan, I started this project on an Instagram page of the same name, 
                using black and white comics and one-paneled pages to vent my frustrations about being queer (and being "bad") 
                in today's climate, one where heternormativity, cisnormativity, capitalism and racism reign supreme. It has 
                grown into a long-term project that I hope will reach many other "bad" queers who want to find solace in doing 
                queerness incorrectly.
                <br><br>
â€‹                I also met my long-term girlfriend, Tim, in Bad Homosexuals, a weird coincidence filled with classroom rivalry 
                and dramatic sexual tension. We fucking hated each other from the first day of class because she thought I was 
                a self-righteous social justice warrior with a penchant for half-baked cultural criticism and I thought she was 
                a normcore white picket fence lesbian whose most radical aspirations summed up to 2.5 kids and a dog. Almost a 
                year and a half and lots of back-and-forth later, she's telling her cat I'm his stepmom. I love her more and 
                more every day.
                <br><br>
                David is still around and we still email back and forth. I recommend you contact him if you're interested in 
                queer literature and fiction.
